''' Async. 
Run logging/any function on a separate thread/process so your main program can continue to run. Achieve with simple syntax:

ai = asyncd.async(fn)
# Thereafter, call ai as a function
ai('your inputs', 'here')

Program will wait for tasks to complete. This differs from the majority of modules in that no "wait()" call is required.



For example for logging on a separate thread:

import asyncd

def logging_fn(name, address):
    import time # be slow
    time.sleep(0.02) 
    print(name, address)

ai_log = asyncd.async(logging_fn)

for req in requests: 
    name, address = req['name'], req['address']
    print(name, address)
    ai_log(name, address)

The print statement will print immediately, ai_log will print with a delay. The program will wait until all requests are processed before exiting.



Suitable for e.g. C100 or other IO constrained problems which cause unnecessary server response delays due to blocks on expensive operations. For operations not requiring confirmation the main thread can continue to process requests while the task waits for the expensive process to complete in the background. 

After timeout (1 sec default) if there are no new operations requested, the thread is stopped, and another is recreated when next needed. The overhead to thread creation is usually several orders of magnitude less than most io operations so as to be minimal. 


Roadmap:

This version (1) improves latency. TODO add decorator.

Version 2: improve bandwidth with a threadpool, maybe processpool option

Version 3: await-able tasks (for operations that needed confirmation, but which you do not want the main thread to block), so e.g. futures/coroutines or callbacks

If you like the approach, feel free to work on the project!  '''
